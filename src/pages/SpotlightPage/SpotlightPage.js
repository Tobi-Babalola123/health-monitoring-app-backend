              Syndromic surveillance is used for the detection, tracking, and
              weekly reporting of a range of diseases and conditions. It offers
              early detection of disease outbreaks, seasonal patterns, and
              geographical variations. The service allows health officials to
              anticipate problems and manage resources effectively.

              In 2019, a record level of opioid-related deaths was noted
              nationally. This surveillance includes monitoring trends in opioid
              overdoses, identifying affected areas, and providing data to
              public health officials to guide resource allocation.

            <h2>RECOMMENDATION: NAS SURVEILLANCE</h2>
            <p className="nas-text">
              The ongoing opioid crisis has produced a surge in neonatal
              abstinence syndrome (NAS). NAS often occurs when a child who was
              exposed to opioids in utero undergoes withdrawal upon delivery;
              afflicted newborns exhibit an array of symptoms, including low
              birth weight, seizures, and difficulties with breathing and
              feeding. From 2000 to 2012, the incidence of NAS quintupled. In
              some hospitals, NAS now accounts for 50% of NICU hospital days.
              Public health officials need up-to-date, comprehensive information
              to work toward limiting the extent, cost, and severity of NAS. But
              they often lack even basic metrics; in many states, NAS has not
              yet been designated a reportable condition. Health Monitoring
              recommends implementing data-gathering systems in maternity wards
              to provide relevant, consistent real-time data about the
              occurrence of substance use disorder among new mothers and NAS
              among newborns.

                <p>
                  Instances of NAS can and should be reported to public health
                  through existing state and local channels. To get the full
                  benefit from such channels, state lawmakers must enact
                  legislation to designate NAS a reportable condition. Adding
                  children with NAS to states‚Äô birth defects registries may also
                  facilitate tracking of treatment outcomes.

                <p>
                  Social service supports are extremely important to
                  NAS-affected infants and their mothers, especially programs
                  that give women access to early prenatal care. Experts urge
                  that these supports be made available to all pregnant women
                  dealing with substance use disorders. Health Monitoring
                  recommends the establishment of centralized data storage and
                  management for agencies working to coordinate outreach and
                  assistance.

                  NAS treatment programs guided by the latest research findings
                  are seeing considerable success. Moving forward, randomized
                  clinical trials are essential to fill the gaps in knowledge
                  about NAS and improve care by shortening hospital stays,
                  reducing treatment costs, and improving infant outcomes.

            <h3>Influenza</h3>
            <p>
              Every year, millions of people fall ill from the flu. The 1918
              influenza epidemic is a cautionary tale of how devastating the flu
              can become if left unchecked. Estimates vary, but some say up to
              500 million people were infected by the 1918 Spanish flu, causing
              as many as 50 million deaths. Health Monitoring is working to
              bring better flu benchmarking to healthcare systems and public
              health so that the impact on facility operations and public health
              intervention is better understood.

              It is estimated that about 85% of healthcare costs are associated

              violation of the EPA‚Äôs lead and copper rule. Health Monitoring is
              working with health departments and water suppliers to better
              detect when the water supply might be causing elevated blood lead
              levels in children and adults.

            <p className="nas-text">
              By 2050, the World Health Organization expects
              antibiotic-resistant disease to be the foremost cause of death
              worldwide. This harrowing news points to the need to better
              understand how antibiotics are being used. In fact, health systems
              are already engaged in antibiotic stewardship programs to ensure
              proper usage of antibiotics. Health Monitoring recommends that
              hospitals and health systems share information and compare the
              work that their stewardship programs are doing. This will allow
              administrators and clinicians to have a better understanding of
              current practices and to determine where improvements can be made.

                  Therapy-day calculations treat one dose and five doses as
                  equivalent if all doses are administered on the same day. But
                  dose amounts can matter to the development of antimicrobial
                  resistance. We can provide feedback on the total quantity of
                  antimicrobials administered. To be meaningful, such
                  comparisons will likely need to consider patient age and
                  possibly patient weight.

                  acquired facilities have noticeably different usage patterns?
                  In addition, facilities may wish to exclude other members of
                  their health system from comparisons and focus on benchmarking
                  only with respect to independent facilities.

              factors also come into play. Refining programs like HRRP calls for
              detailed, current data. Health Monitoring is working to make such

              before the president declared it a national public health
              emergency in 2017. Much of the work has centered on tracking fatal
              and non-fatal overdoses. One important component is missing,
              however. That is tracking the efficacy of rehabilitation programs.
              Once addicted to opioids, a person with a substance use disorder
              has three potential outcomes: they go through rehab successfully,
              they overdose, or they get off drugs on their own. Health
              Monitoring recommends tracking the progress of patients through
