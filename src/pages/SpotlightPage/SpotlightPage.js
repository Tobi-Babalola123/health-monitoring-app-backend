            <p>
              Syndromic surveillance is used for the detection, tracking, and
              weekly reporting of a range of diseases and conditions. It offers
              early detection of disease outbreaks, seasonal patterns, and
              geographical variations. The service allows health officials to
              anticipate problems and manage resources effectively.

            <p>
              In 2019, a record level of opioid-related deaths was noted
              nationally. This surveillance includes monitoring trends in opioid
              overdoses, identifying affected areas, and providing data to
              public health officials to guide resource allocation.

            <p>
              In 2017, NAS in infants was commented about in media and public
              health circles. The surveillance focuses on early detection,
              ensuring timely response by health officials and enhancing public
              safety. It provides real-time information to aid in intervention
              efforts.

            <h2>Recommendation: NAS Surveillance</h2>
            <p className="nas-text">
              The ongoing opioid crisis has produced a surge in neonatal
              abstinence syndrome (NAS). NAS often occurs when a child who was
              exposed to opioids in utero undergoes withdrawal upon delivery;
              afflicted newborns exhibit an array of symptoms, including low
              birth weight, seizures, and difficulties with breathing and
              feeding. From 2000 to 2012, the incidence of NAS quintupled. In
              some hospitals, NAS now accounts for 50% of NICU hospital days.
              Public health officials need up-to-date, comprehensive information
              to work toward limiting the extent, cost, and severity of NAS. But
              they often lack even basic metrics; in many states, NAS has not
              yet been designated a reportable condition. Health Monitoring
              recommends implementing data-gathering systems in maternity wards
              to provide relevant, consistent real-time data about the
              occurrence of substance use disorder among new mothers and NAS
              among newborns.
